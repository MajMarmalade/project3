      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Trent Kauflin, I am a first year Cybersecurity Major who
        could have gone to art school. Instead of doing that however, I chose to
        go to IIT in hopes of making that "<i>cybersecurity salary bank</i>."
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to fund my true dream of becoming a tattoo artist... at least
        thats what I think it is right now.

      <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      <h4>Guitar:</h4>
      <p>
        Despite not being very good I own 5 guitars, and 4 amps. My favorite
        guitar is a sea foam green Danelectro Baritone. Most of my time playing
        guitar is spent messing around and trying to make fun metal riffs on
        this guitar.
      </p>
      <h4>Art:</h4>
      <p>
        I love illustrating, drawing different characters, and using them to tell
        stories. In my high school years I designed my own Tarot Deck, and
        started a variety of unfinished comics.
      </p>
      <h4>Game Design:</h4>
      <p>
        I have worked on and done art for multiple games. One of which being a
        3D cart racing game called "<a href="https://chasevelloney.itch.io/sirkartman">Sir Kart Man</a>
        " that I worked on with my friend Chase.
