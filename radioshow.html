      <h1>Aggressively Midwestern</h1>
      <p>
        This is my Radio Show that I run with my friend on the schools radio
        station WIIT 88.9 FM.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value the openness of expression through music which is why we run in
        a timeslot that does not require the censoring of our music.

      <h2>A Description Of Our Show</h2>
      <p>
        Hailing from the rust-ridden backyards of the American midwest, two
        Cryptid Co-Hosts are taking you on an angsty road trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        From seedy basement shows with bands whose names are too long to
        remember, to drowning yourself in a bottle of ranch after your latest
        breakup. Scream along as DJ's Dogman and Kitchen Goblin soundtrack your
        misery with both the big names and the unknowns of Midwest emo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or whatever else fits the vibe of whiny vocals belted into a walmart
        mic, and buzzing guitars emanating from your parents garage. Join us
        Thursdays at 10:00 to 11:30 PM and forget about "Midwest-Polite" cause
        we are "Aggressively Midwestern".
      </p>
